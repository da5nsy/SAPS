Notes from Google Keep:

Woke at 742
Read news on phone for roughly half an hour
Had porridge with tinned peaches for breakfast
Left 915, walk to Tottenham Hale - cloudy/overcast day, but quite bright
930 board underground
Roughly 950 - short walk to UCL from Euston, looks like rain coming
Changed from red glasses to black glasses (thru have a subtle brass coloured interior)
1050 left UCL
Bought lunch and a snack of a raspberry muffin
1100 boarded underground at Euston 
1115 arrive Tuffnel Park
5 minute walk (heavy cloud but dry) to PAMELA
Setting up space- under standard house lights (fluorescent?)

Notes from notebook. 
(Where a time is followed by a ')' this means that it was written out of order in notebook)
(Where a time is followed by a '~' this means 'roughly')

1145	Switching to written log to avoid screen exposure
1145	Begin adaptation to 'cool white' preset
1150	First run of experiment after 5 mins adaptation. Called (using mobile) to ask Tatsuto for a clock so as to avoid telling time by an emissive clock (phone). From now on will only use phone in emergency.

Plans for rest of day:
Aims:
Test SAPS in controlled environment
- Do different lighting conditions (and assumed different states of chromatic adaptation) influence responses in SAPS?
- How much of the effect is instantaneous vs caused by longer time?
- Is there a mel-high vs mel-low effect (if there's time to test)

1215	Cool white 2
1218	End, change to warm white. Took 3 repeat measurements with UPtrek (after dark calibration). WW seems substantially dimmer than CW.
1223	WW1. Screen of tablet doesn't appear green cast as it did before.
1230	(roughly) Tatsuto does a run of the experiment. I spend a minute adding name in python and changing previous names in excel.
1248	Filled in Health & Safety forms
1248)	WW2?
1251	CW lights on
1256	CW3
1252)	Started eating lunch - 'superfood salad'
1308	Started reading Olafur Elliasson book
1310	Decided against reading- the pages, whilst achromatic, are subtly yellowed with age, and fill a large area of my vision whilst reading. Opted instead to spend 5 seconds turning on radio on my phone. (Admittedly, the notedbook in which I write this is also slightly yellow)
1318	Tatsuto CW ('yellow + green appear darker')
1321	CW4
1325	3 x spectro (CW) (After dark calibration)
1326 	WW on
1332	WW3
1328)	Went back through log and realised '1248 WW2' had been missed. I checked excel to see whether the session had been missed and it had not, I must have just forgotten to note it.
1340	Note: Tatsuto had roughly 5 minutes adaptation time
1357	WW4
1400	Fiddling around with the controller to make 'mel-high'
1411	Took 3x mel high spec measurements (and again?)
1440~	Mel high on
1445	Katherine under mel high(1)
1450~	DG Mel High 1
1520	KC MH2 -'aiming more for point where colours come together'
1523	DG MH2. 3x spec MH
1527	CW on (mel low)
1535	KC CW/ML 1
1539	DG CW/ML 1
1557	KC CW/ML 2
1603~	MH lights on
1609	3 x spec measurements
1611	Corrected the time and date on UPtrek
1636	DG MH2 (messed up, excel was open so failed to save)
1645~	Repeat of above, but having stared angrily at a screen for several minutes
1700~	Tatsuto MH
