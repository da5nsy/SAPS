Started taking measurements under warm white at 1521

1529 finish white under warm white
Last one of red was actually white (code) screen)
Did a few extra as above for green (repeatability)
1546 started blue

1553 turned on cool white
Started white

19/20/21 is a dark field (two pairs of clicks for each one)

For MH (Mel high) 1 and 2 are dark field
21 is accidental code screen

Then did CW > White2 (later edit: I think I meant WW here rather than CW)
